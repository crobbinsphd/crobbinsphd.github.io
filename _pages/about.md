Welcome, it is wonderful to meet you! My name is Caroline Robbins, and I am a Ph.D. student of political science. My primary focuses are international relations and comparative politics, with research interests in diplomacy, rhetorical framing strategies, elite behavior, and great power politics.

I completed my education at the Florida State University and am pursuing a career in academia. My work is pending publication in the Journal of Exprimental Political Science (JEPS). Please reach out if you would like to chat about any of my work!
