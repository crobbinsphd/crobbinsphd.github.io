I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Florida State University, with focuses in International Relations and Comparative Politics. I study elite rhetorical strategies, democratic backsliding, and ontological security in the context of shifting global dynamics. Methodologically, I employ survey experiment and text-as-data approaches to understand elite framing of crisis politics and their impact on public opinion and security perceptions.

My work is currently under review at the *Journal of Experimental Political Science* and *International Organization*.
