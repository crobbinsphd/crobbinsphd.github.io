This class explores the principles that shape international relations and illustrates these
principles with examples drawn from history and contemporary world politics. The goals
of the course are threefold. First, this course introduces students to the major concepts,
theories, and topics in the study of international relations. Second, the course aims to
increase understanding of current international issues. A third goal of the course is to
develop each student’s analytical reasoning skills.

The foundations of politics are interests, interactions, and institutions, both domestic and
international. After discussing the primary actors in world politics and the interests they
pursue, we will explain why actors do not always get what they want. Next, we address
why war occurs and what can be done to promote peace. Then, we turn our attention to
international political economy. We will address the following questions: If trade
promotes wealth, why do all countries restrict trade in some way? Why do some
countries restrict trade more than others? How do nations manage the relationship
between currencies? Why are some countries rich and others poor? In the final part of
the course, we turn our attention to transnational advocacy networks, terrorism, human
rights, and the global environment. How do transnational networks influence politics?
Why do some transnational actors use terrorism? What can be done to prevent terrorism?
Why do states protect the human rights of people in other countries? Why is it so hard to
cooperate internationally to protect the global environment? By the end of the course
students will understand the central dilemmas in world politics and know ways to
mitigate these dilemmas. Students who master the material will also be able to provide
cogent answers to each question mentioned in this paragraph.
