TA for POS3713 - Political Science Research Methods, the undergraduate required course for all political science majors at Florida State University. The course's primary focuses are on introductory statistics, introductory causal inference, and study design.

My primary role was in writing exams and grading assignments focused on ensuring proper understanding of statistical analysis.
