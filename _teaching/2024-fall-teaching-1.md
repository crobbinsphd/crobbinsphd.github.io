Lead TA for INR2002 - Introduction to International Affairs. This is a survey course for undergraduate students to learn about the foundations of international relations literature, introductions to theories of conflict and international political economy (i.e. bargaining models of war, Heckscher-Ohlin), and emerging scholarship of public opinion in IR.

My primary roles were in fostering discussion among students and supervising grading.

Instructor(s) of Record: Dr. Sean Ehrlich (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025) (sehrlich@fsu.edu) and Dr. Dotan Haim (Fall 2025) (dhaim@fsu.edu)
