TA for POS3930 - Advanced Seminar on Political Science Research Methods, a specialized undergraduate course for Research-Intensive Bachelor's Certificate students. The course focuses on survey experiment design, survey development, academic draft writing, and data presentation for aspiring researchers.

My primary role was to evaulate student research designs and aid in instruction on survey development and launch.
