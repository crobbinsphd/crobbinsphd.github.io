## Abstract

Does democratic backsliding in allied states affect the public’s willingness to support fulfilling alliance obligations? Despite growing interest in understanding backsliding, less attention has been paid to understanding how backsliding will change foreign policy and international relations. We argue that backsliding is likely to reduce the public’s perceptions of an ally’s compatibility and reliability, which reduces their willingness to provide support. Across two survey experiments in the United States, we find robust evidence that the public is less supportive of fulfilling obligations for a backsliding ally. Additionally, backsliding reduces perceptions of compatibility and reliability, and these perceptions mediate backsliding even when controlling for alternative explanations. Finally, the public indicates willingness to vote for a President that abandons an ally when they experience backsliding, suggesting audience costs may be conditional. Taken together, we find that backsliding around the world has the potential to destabilize long-standing alliance networks central to foreign policy.
