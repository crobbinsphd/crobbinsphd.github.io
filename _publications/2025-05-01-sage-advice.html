Who decides to send Nixon to China? Challenging prior conventions arguing for state or leader supremacy in the foreign policy decisionmaking process, Jost et al. (2024) asserts that the hawkish disposition of a leader's advisory counsel has a clear, systemic influence on the overall amount of conflictual foreign policy decisions pursued by the leader. Stemming from the logic that advisers provide critical information to leaders to allow them to make informed decisions, and this information is colored by the advisers' aggregate dispositions, there is clear evidence to support the notion that advisers do influence foreign policy to some degree. However, advisers are not mere puppets of their leader and their own experience in the field of international relations may play a key role in what they choose to recommend and what disposition they take when affording counsel. Using Jost et al. (2024)'s data on foreign policy deliberations during the Cold War (1947-1988), I find that the effect of the president's hawkish disposition shifts when their experience outweighs that of their advisers, introducing a potential tension between the two actors in whose voice maintains the strongest weight. This opens up fruitful discussion on the endogeneity of adviser selection and how best to approach advisers as distinct actors from leaders when assessing their role in determining hawkish international policy.
